â€‹Well, The line will be straight iff slope between each vertices are same(equal). we need to check the slope between each vertices are equal or not. We can do by using simple slope formula BUT

Don't Use : slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) , It will give Runtime error when Denominator is ZERO.
Deriving the slope equation : del Y/ del X = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) where del Y=(y2-y1), del X=(x2-x1). Make this as simple non Denominator Equation and take work done.

Look code for better understanding :)
